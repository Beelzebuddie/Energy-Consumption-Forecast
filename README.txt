 Time Series Forecasting with Machine Learning

 Overview
This notebook demonstrates the process of forecasting energy consumption using machine learning techniques, specifically with the XGBoost regressor. The dataset used for this analysis is the [Hourly Energy Consumption dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/robikscube/hourly-energy-consumption?resource=download) from Kaggle.

PJM East is a specific area within the PJM Interconnection, a regional transmission organization that manages the electric grid and wholesale electricity market in parts of the Eastern and Midwestern United States. PJM East covers areas such as Delaware, the District of Columbia, New Jersey, and parts of Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia. This sub-region helps ensure the reliable operation of the electric grid and efficient electricity markets within these areas.

 1. Setup and Data Loading

 Importing Libraries
The necessary libraries for data manipulation (pandas, numpy), visualization (matplotlib, seaborn), and machine learning (xgboost, sklearn) are imported. The dataset is read from a CSV file, and the 'Datetime' column is set as the index and converted to a datetime object for time series analysis.

 2. Initial Data Visualization

 Plotting Energy Use
The entire time series data is plotted to observe trends and patterns. This helps in understanding the overall behavior of the data over time.

 3. Train/Test Split

 Splitting the Data
The data is divided into training and test sets based on a specific date (01-01-2015). The training set includes data before this date, and the test set includes data from this date onward. The split is visualized to ensure the correct separation of training and testing data.

 4. Weekly Data Visualization

 Plotting Weekly Data
A subset of the data is plotted to analyze patterns over a week. This helps in understanding short-term fluctuations and daily cycles in the data.

 5. Feature Engineering

 Creating Time-Based Features
Time-based features such as hour, day of the week, month, and year are created from the datetime index. These features are essential for capturing temporal patterns in the data.

 6. Feature/Target Relationship Visualization

 Visualizing Relationships
Box plots are used to visualize how energy consumption varies by hour and month. This helps in identifying daily and monthly trends and patterns in the data.

 7. Model Creation

 Training the Model
An XGBoost regressor is trained on the training data using the engineered features. The model's performance is evaluated using the test data, and the training process is monitored to avoid overfitting.

 8. Feature Importance

 Analyzing Feature Importance
The importance of each feature in the model is plotted to understand their impact on predictions. This helps in identifying the most influential features for the forecasting model.

 9. Forecast on Test Set

 Making Predictions
The model's predictions are compared to the actual values on the test set. The predicted values are plotted alongside the actual values to visually evaluate the model's performance.

 10. Score (RMSE)

 Evaluating Model Performance
The root mean squared error (RMSE) is calculated to quantify the model's accuracy. This metric provides an indication of how well the model's predictions match the actual values.

 11. Calculate Error

 Analyzing Prediction Errors
The errors in the model's predictions are calculated and analyzed to identify the dates with the highest prediction errors. This helps in understanding the model's limitations and areas for improvement.

 Next Steps

- Implement more robust cross-validation techniques to improve model reliability.
- Add additional features such as weather forecasts and holidays to enhance the model's predictive capabilities.
